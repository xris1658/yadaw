# Audio and MIDI API on macOS

If only I had a device running macOS ;-)

See [Core Audio](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreaudio) and [Core MIDI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremidi).

It might be a good idea to use cross-platform audio APIs such as JACK, RtAudio, PortAudio or PulseAudio.
